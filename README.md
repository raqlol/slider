Version 2: Left and Right Arrows
In progress

All versions allows for easy addition of slides via the HTML file. All list items, except the last, must have the class start-right. The image without a class will be the first image of the slides. Ul and li tags in the slider should not have any characters or returns between tags to avoid empty slides. All images should be horizontal for best results.
