JS slider
A pure Javascript responsive image slider

Current functionality allows for:
Auto play
Arrow progression

This implementation allows for easy addition of slides via the HTML file. All list items, except the last, must have the class start-right. The image without a class will be the first image of the slides. Ul and li tags in the slider should not have any characters or returns between tags to avoid empty slides.
